## 🚀 How to use this repository

### 1️⃣ Clone the entire repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathiusEc/Programacion---II.git
cd Programacion---II
```

### 2️⃣ Work with a specific project

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Each folder is an independent project that must be opened separately in IntelliJ IDEA.

**Steps to work with a project:**

1. **Copy the folder** of the topic you want to practice to your desktop or working directory
2. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**
3. **Select:** `File → Open`
4. **Navigate to the copied folder** (e.g., `Creación de Objetos`)
5. **Open the entire folder** (not just the .java file)

The `.iml` file will automatically configure the project in IntelliJ.

### 3️⃣ Structure of each project

Each topic folder contains:
- **`src/`**: Java source files (.java)
- **`.iml`**: IntelliJ project configuration file
- The `out/` folders are excluded from the repository (build artifacts)

### 4️⃣ Adding your own exercises from university computers

When working on university computers without repository access:

1. **Work normally** on your project in IntelliJ
2. **Copy only these items** to transfer:
   - The project folder (e.g., `New Exercise/`)
   - The `src/` subfolder with your .java files
   - The `.iml` configuration file
3. **Paste the folder** into your local `Ejercicios_II/` directory
4. **Commit and push** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [exercise name]"
   git push
   ```

> **Note:** Do NOT copy the `out/` folder - it contains compiled files and is excluded by `.gitignore`

## 📝 Notes

- This repository is updated constantly with new exercises and topics throughout the semester
- Each project is self-contained and can be run independently
- All projects are configured for IntelliJ IDEA
